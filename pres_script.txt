Here's what I learned:
Periodic waves can be represented as a sum of sinusoids
Using this, we can transform a function of time into
	a function of coefficients for a wave and vice versa
A discrete fourier series is comprised of individual "samples"
	of a continuous wave
Thus, discrete fourier transforms can be used on bits
Regular FTs have O(n^2), FFTs have O(nlogn), and QFTs have O(log^2n)
By reading classical bits as qubits (quantum bits),
	we can use QFTs on sets of classical bit data
We draw up quantum circuits using a variety of gates
	inherent to quantum computing,
	such as Hadamard gates, swaps, etc.
Quantum computing is probablistic, so any transform must
	analyze output distributions
	based on multiple "shots"/samples
"Noise" will be transmitted with a QFT because of this
Thus, audio generation and analysis will not be pure
	or at least as pure as FTs in the classical sphere
